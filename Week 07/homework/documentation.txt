Snippet of Code:

.column2 {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 10px;
    height: 250px; 
    border-right: 2.5px solid black;
    border-top: 2.5px solid black;
    border-bottom: 2.5px solid black;
    position: relative;
    overflow-y: scroll;
    overflow-x: hidden;
}

I learned how to get the scrolling bar on my boxes, and how to only have one showing which is the overflow-y. 
Because initally without it, I would have 2 scroll bars on the bottom(x) and the side(y). 
And I figured out that you could just hide the bottom one, by specifying which way you wanted the scroll to be. 


Next Steps:
If I had more time I would add more elements to my website like images and interactive elements (transitions, effects, etc). 
I would also change up the mobile and lablet's navigation menu, so it doesn't look that out of place. 
Maybe add some logos and emojis around, so my website doesn't look so plain and flat.
