                <p>
                    In the game Inside the Backrooms, The Smiler (ENTITY #3) is a static 2D PNG image with a perpetual grin that appears in dark areas in the Dark Rooms. It kills players if looked at for too long in the dark.

                <br/>
                <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>
                    In the lurking darkness, these walls shelters something mysterious, a "bright smiling thing" that stands out from the shadows. Rumors says that it's has a physical body that cannot be seen with the human eye. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is only known that it is attracted to all sources of light and that if traps you in the void the shadows you will probably never see the light again.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember, a smile does not always reflect peace, if not quite the opposite..             
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Entity Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                    The Smiler is a static enemy. When you first spot the Smiler, a 4-second timer begins and will cause a player's flashlight to flicker while playing a sound. If the timer reaches 0 while you are in the Smiler's line of sight, it will drain your sanity and eventually kill you. The only way to reset the timer If the player goes back into a well-lit area for at least 4 seconds. Players are also safe during the Smiler's fade-in and fade-out animations. If a player touches the Smiler directly, it will immediately kill the player via contact damage.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Strategies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Upon entering the Dark Rooms, The Smiler spawns every 10-30 seconds at a following a set of waypoints, which are predetermined locations that it can spawn at. It will try to avoid being seen by players, and will move to darker areas of the game world if possible. It is also possible for the Smiler to spawn where it would normally never be seen if a light breaks. After appearing, the Smiler will disappear after a duration of 10-30 seconds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Always keep an eye on your surroundings in dark areas.
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        Avoid direct contact with the Smiler at all costs, as it can instantly kill you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use sound cues to detect the Smiler's presence, as it emits sounds when near.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you accidentally look at a Smiler and the sound plays, try to get out of its line of sight as fast as possible.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If you have broken eye contact and you are still in the darkness, just stay there for at least 30 seconds to wait for the Smiler to go away, as you will probably not be able to make it to a light source without dying.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you have broken eye contact and you are out of the darkness, you're safe from the Smiler's threat and you can observe it as you wish, almost like nothing happened. If you enter back into the darkness, the process repeats.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                <h3>Extra</h3>
