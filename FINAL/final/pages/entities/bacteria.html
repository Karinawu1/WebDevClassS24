                <h2 class="title">Entity: Bacteria</h2>
                <p>In the game, Inside the Backrooms, Bacteria is found in the Dark Rooms (Level 2). The entity appears as a tall, lanky, dark creature made of slimy bacteria with no distinct features. It turns the fluorescent lights near it red and chases players, roaring loudly upon sight.</p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>
                    It is a humanoid that seems to be made of cable, for some reason, it is believed it has control of the place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it is close the environment of the rooms changes and it seems to be attracted by electronic devices and radio frequencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So when you are in the same area as it, be very careful, you don't want to attract your own death.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Entity Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                    Once spawned, Bacteria will make loud stomping sounds as it wanders off to different locations, pausing for 45 seconds before moving to a new area. It will change the lights in the area around it red. When it spots a player, it will roar loudly and chase after them. It is the only entity without a hitbox, meaning you can just run through it.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Strategies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Avoid areas with red lighting to evade Bacteria.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be cautious with radios in its vicinity, as it's attracted to radio waves.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If it starts chasing you, hide in lockers or use walls and doors to lose its interest.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On Hard difficulty, Bacteria goes from a basic entity to a run killer. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Avoid it at all costs as it can one-shot you from full health.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                <h3>Extra</h3>
                <p>
                    If the player gets killed by this type of entity, the player will be awarded the <a href='../achievements/achievements.html'>ENTITY #VICTIM</a> achievement.
