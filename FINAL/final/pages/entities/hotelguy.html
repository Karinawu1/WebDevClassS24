                <h2 class="title">Entity: Receptionist</h2>
                <p>In the game, Inside the Backrooms, the Receptionist is found in the Terror Hotel (Level 6). The entity appears as a humanoid, wearing a gas mask. They become hostile when they see non-hotel guests.</p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>
                    Almost nothing is known about these entities, they are humanoids that wear a non-human face.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Apparently, they watch the hotel as they wander through all the rooms and corridors, they have been seen vomitting a green liquid which is highly harmful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be careful not to run into any of them, because they are quite hostile to those who are not hotel guests. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Entity Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                    It is rumored that they like to eat the cocoons of the moths that inhabit the area. Very rarely they have been seen eating in the main dining room. 
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Strategies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Avoid being seen by these entities if all possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep an eye out and avoid the green liquid they throw up in the halls. 
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        The entity is fast and is recommended best to hide. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       Hide in the closet if you suspect you've been found.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                <h3>Extra</h3>
