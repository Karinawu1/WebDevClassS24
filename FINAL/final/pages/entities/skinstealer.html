                <h2 class="title">Entity: Skin Stealer</h2>
                <p>The Skin Stealer is a seemingly skinless humanoid with elongated limbs, it's tall and thin, with a distinct long and horrifying mouth, decorated with tiny sharp teeth. It also has two small, red eyes that peer through the darkness. The Parking lot Skin Stealer is thinner and more red in color than the one found in the Abandoned Office and Terror Hotel.

                <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>
                  There is no information card on them. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Entity Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                    The Skin Stealer is a creature that can be encountered in the game. The creature is relatively slow and docile when wandering, but when it is after you, it can run nearly at player sprinting speed, and is hard to escape without a Moth Jelly or Locker. Both types are attracted to noise, such as the sound of eating pills or whistling. It can see you from a farther distance if you are injured. It is however quite easy to dodge, as sprinting past it on its side should suffice.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Strategies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        At the start of the Parking Lot, it will be seen feasting on a corpse for a short period of time, unless the first valve is activated, the player makes a loud sound like eating pills or whistling, or the player chooses to approach it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the Abandoned Office, the skin stealer will spawn in a random location as soon as the lights go out.
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        In the Terror Hotel, the skin stealer will spawn immediately in a random location.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hide in closets to get away from them. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                <h3>Extra</h3>
                <p>
                    If the player gets killed by this type of entity, the player will be awarded the <a href='../achievements/achievements.html'>ENTITY #10 #VICTIM</a> achievement.
