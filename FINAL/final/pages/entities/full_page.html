                    Once spawned, Bacteria will make loud stomping sounds as it wanders off to different locations, pausing for 45 seconds before moving to a new area. It will change the lights in the area around it red. When it spots a player, it will roar loudly and chase after them. It is the only entity without a hitbox, meaning you can just run through it.

                <p>
                    In the game Inside the Backrooms, Hound (ENTITY #8) is a dog-humanoid hybrid found in the Dark Rooms (Level 2), Sewerage (Level 5), and Pool Rooms (Level 4) levels with red-eyed, human-like features. It gets agitated when it spots you, is sensitive to sound, and can be lured by whistling. It spawns in response to loud noises or after a set time and can despawn by returning to vents. In specific locations, it has unique spawning conditions.              
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>
                    A very strange creature has been spotted coming out from ducts in the backrooms, it's physiology resembles a dog with humanoid traits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is known that is very aggressive and dangerous, but also is annoyed by noise and is intimidated by direct eye contact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So when you look at it face to the face, be smart, there are times when running away doesn't help much.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Entity Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                    The Hound will emerge from a nearby vent if a loud noise occurs, such as the shattering of a mirror or a vase, or after a specific period of time if no loud noise has been made (approximately 4 minutes). It despawns by jumping back into the vents, signified by a distinct growl and metal sounds. When the Hound encounters a player, it will stand there intimidated for a certain period (about 5-10 seconds), during which it emits a soft growling noise before attacking. If the player sprints, it will chase after the player. If it loses sight of the player, it will go back to normal.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Strategies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Avoid creating loud noises like sprinting or whistling when the Hound is nearby.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be careful when shattering a vase or mirror, as this will immediately spawn the Hound.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can use a <a href="../items/items.html">Screwdriver</a> to close vents a Hound has emerged from to prevent it from entering/exiting that vent ever again
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While hounds may spawn from vents, there is no need to worry if you notice steam coming out of the vents. It is simply a part of the game's ambiance, created to generate a sense of fear.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It possesses remarkable speed, nearly matching a sprinting player's pace.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Hound has a 50% chance to spawn in the garbage area in the Sewerage. (It can enter the water)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you see a Hound staring at you while intimidated, you can easily lose its interest by breaking the line of sight while maintaining eye contact and slowly walking away.
                        <ul>
                            <li>However, if a Hound is chasing you because you sprinted, just find the nearest locker to hide in until it walks away.
                            </li>
                            <li>When needing to evade the Hound, either sprint at full speed past it or run at a roughly 45-degree angle backward during its attacking animation to dodge and minimize the chances of being hit.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    In the game Inside the Backrooms, The Smiler (ENTITY #3) is a static 2D PNG image with a perpetual grin that appears in dark areas in the Dark Rooms. It kills players if looked at for too long in the dark.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>
                    In the lurking darkness, these walls shelters something mysterious, a "bright smiling thing" that stands out from the shadows. Rumors says that it's has a physical body that cannot be seen with the human eye. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is only known that it is attracted to all sources of light and that if traps you in the void the shadows you will probably never see the light again.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember, a smile does not always reflect peace, if not quite the opposite..

                <br/>
                <h3>Entity Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                    The Smiler is a static enemy. When you first spot the Smiler, a 4-second timer begins and will cause a player's flashlight to flicker while playing a sound. If the timer reaches 0 while you are in the Smiler's line of sight, it will drain your sanity and eventually kill you. The only way to reset the timer If the player goes back into a well-lit area for at least 4 seconds. Players are also safe during the Smiler's fade-in and fade-out animations. If a player touches the Smiler directly, it will immediately kill the player via contact damage.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Strategies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Upon entering the Dark Rooms, The Smiler spawns every 10-30 seconds at a following a set of waypoints, which are predetermined locations that it can spawn at. It will try to avoid being seen by players, and will move to darker areas of the game world if possible. It is also possible for the Smiler to spawn where it would normally never be seen if a light breaks. After appearing, the Smiler will disappear after a duration of 10-30 seconds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Always keep an eye on your surroundings in dark areas.
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        Avoid direct contact with the Smiler at all costs, as it can instantly kill you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use sound cues to detect the Smiler's presence, as it emits sounds when near.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you accidentally look at a Smiler and the sound plays, try to get out of its line of sight as fast as possible.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If you have broken eye contact and you are still in the darkness, just stay there for at least 30 seconds to wait for the Smiler to go away, as you will probably not be able to make it to a light source without dying.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you have broken eye contact and you are out of the darkness, you're safe from the Smiler's threat and you can observe it as you wish, almost like nothing happened. If you enter back into the darkness, the process repeats.

                    The Skin Stealer is a creature that can be encountered in the game. The creature is relatively slow and docile when wandering, but when it is after you, it can run nearly at player sprinting speed, and is hard to escape without a Moth Jelly or Locker. Both types are attracted to noise, such as the sound of eating pills or whistling. It can see you from a farther distance if you are injured. It is however quite easy to dodge, as sprinting past it on its side should suffice.

                    The Partygoer is an in-game entity that will wander around the present maze, or move through the walls of the candle maze. In the present maze, if the lights turn red, the Partygoer will look around for the player, if the player is in their line of sight, it will immediately chase them, whereas in the candle maze, it will simply chase the player, even walking through the red lines. In the present maze, the player has a chance to evade the Partygoer by running around a corner if they are far enough away. However, in the candle maze, the Partygoer will continuously pursue the player, making it impossible to escape once activated.

                    In the game, Inside the Backrooms, Clumps is found in the Sewage and Pool Rooms. (Level 5). The creature appears to be a mutated, red-ish monster that crawls using several humanoid arms.

                <p>
                   This creature consists of multiple limbs, they don't have eyes and ears, so the only way to be attacked by them creatures is getting very close to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                   They are very dangerous and sneaky, they move in groups searching for food.

                <p>
                   It's a good idea to always use a motion tracker in order to prevent attacks of these creatures.

                <p>
                    Beneath the dark water lurks deadly spiders called Clumps. They can instantly kill you when you get close. Their movement seems to be random and slightly slower than walking pace. By carefully observing their movement pattern, it is possible to avoid them, as they are blind and deaf and cannot sense your presence unless you touch them. They seem to be quite sensitive to the presence of oil, as the Clumps in the water treatment room will leave the water and jump up onto the ceiling when the water is contaminated with oil. Clumps come in two different sizes and can be found in the Sewerage and the Pool Rooms. The small ones can be found swimming in the water, while the big ones (who can walk on land) can be found in rooms such as the counterweight room, barrel room, and water treatment room.

                <p>The Death Rat is a significantly large rat with an appearance that is unmistakable. Its body is covered in a multitude of wounds and is missing it's eyes. Despite its scarred body, it still appears strong and tough due to its muscular build. It has a little bit of fur on it's back, being matted and unkempt, making it appear even more menacing. In terms of size, it is much larger than the average rat and can be quite intimidating to those who encounter it.

                    In the old sewer tunnels some forsaken creatures are housed, in the deepest corners of this space. They have never known outside light, adapting in this dark.

                    Humid and disturbing environment in order to survive, their bodies are full of infections and their snouts are full of maligant bacteria.

                    They are blind althrough they are extremely aggressive, they have managed to develop a hearing that is very sensitive to any noise, if you run into one try not to move or make noise, remember for them we are only fresh meat in the middle of an endless wet tunnels.

                <h3>Entity Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                    There are two Death Rats that aimlessly roam throughout the Sewerage and is unable to see, meaning it won't detect you even if you're right in front of it. However, be careful as any noise you make, like footsteps or whistling, will instantly draw its attention to the source of the sound, so if you see it, I'd recommend moving over to the side of the water and letting it pass. Most of the time the Death Rat is standing up, but sometimes it will run through the sewers on all fours. The Death Rat cannot get you while you are inside a room.
