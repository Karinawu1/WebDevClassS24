                <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>
                    In the old and abandonded corridors are giant flying insects, distinguished by a figure that resembles a skull on their back.
                </p>
                <p>
                   They are attacted to light and more when the source hits them directly, however, when they do not have visbility, it is difficult for them to find threats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are extremely territorial and aggressive, so if you see one run and don't look back.
