                    In the game, Inside the Backrooms, Clumps is found in the Sewage and Pool Rooms. (Level 5). The creature appears to be a mutated, red-ish monster that crawls using several humanoid arms.

                <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>
                   This creature consists of multiple limbs, they don't have eyes and ears, so the only way to be attacked by them creatures is getting very close to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                   They are very dangerous and sneaky, they move in groups searching for food.
                </p>
                <p>
                   It's a good idea to always use a motion tracker in order to prevent attacks of these creatures.
                </p>

                <h3>Entity Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                    Beneath the dark water lurks deadly spiders called Clumps. They can instantly kill you when you get close. Their movement seems to be random and slightly slower than walking pace. By carefully observing their movement pattern, it is possible to avoid them, as they are blind and deaf and cannot sense your presence unless you touch them. They seem to be quite sensitive to the presence of oil, as the Clumps in the water treatment room will leave the water and jump up onto the ceiling when the water is contaminated with oil. Clumps come in two different sizes and can be found in the Sewerage and the Pool Rooms. The small ones can be found swimming in the water, while the big ones (who can walk on land) can be found in rooms such as the counterweight room, barrel room, and water treatment room.
