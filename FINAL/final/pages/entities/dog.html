                <p>
                    In the game Inside the Backrooms, Hound (ENTITY #8) is a dog-humanoid hybrid found in the Dark Rooms (Level 2), Sewerage (Level 5), and Pool Rooms (Level 4) levels with red-eyed, human-like features. It gets agitated when it spots you, is sensitive to sound, and can be lured by whistling. It spawns in response to loud noises or after a set time and can despawn by returning to vents. In specific locations, it has unique spawning conditions.              
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>
                    A very strange creature has been spotted coming out from ducts in the backrooms, it's physiology resembles a dog with humanoid traits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is known that is very aggressive and dangerous, but also is annoyed by noise and is intimidated by direct eye contact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So when you look at it face to the face, be smart, there are times when running away doesn't help much.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Entity Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                    The Hound will emerge from a nearby vent if a loud noise occurs, such as the shattering of a mirror or a vase, or after a specific period of time if no loud noise has been made (approximately 4 minutes). It despawns by jumping back into the vents, signified by a distinct growl and metal sounds. When the Hound encounters a player, it will stand there intimidated for a certain period (about 5-10 seconds), during which it emits a soft growling noise before attacking. If the player sprints, it will chase after the player. If it loses sight of the player, it will go back to normal.
                </p>

                <h3>Strategies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Avoid creating loud noises like sprinting or whistling when the Hound is nearby.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be careful when shattering a vase or mirror, as this will immediately spawn the Hound.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can use a <a href="../items/items.html">Screwdriver</a> to close vents a Hound has emerged from to prevent it from entering/exiting that vent ever again
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While hounds may spawn from vents, there is no need to worry if you notice steam coming out of the vents. It is simply a part of the game's ambiance, created to generate a sense of fear.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It possesses remarkable speed, nearly matching a sprinting player's pace.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Hound has a 50% chance to spawn in the garbage area in the Sewerage. (It can enter the water)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you see a Hound staring at you while intimidated, you can easily lose its interest by breaking the line of sight while maintaining eye contact and slowly walking away.
                        <ul>
                            <li>However, if a Hound is chasing you because you sprinted, just find the nearest locker to hide in until it walks away.
                            </li>
                            <li>When needing to evade the Hound, either sprint at full speed past it or run at a roughly 45-degree angle backward during its attacking animation to dodge and minimize the chances of being hit.
                            </li>
                        </ul>                    
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                <h3>Extra</h3>
                <p>
                    If the player gets killed by this type of entity, the player will be awarded the <a href='../achievements/achievements.html'></a>ENTITY #8 VICTIM</a> achievement.
