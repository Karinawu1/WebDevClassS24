        <p>This recipe is the first food I cooked in my life. My best friend taught me how to make this. 
            A basic spaghetti recipe with store-bought Marinara sauce, because I don't know how to cook.

        <ul>
            <!-- Individual items in an ordered or unordered list, li tag -->
            <li>70g of Store Brought Spaghetti (any brand works)</li>
            <li>1 cup of Marinara Sauce (Go by Preference, I used Prego for this recipe)</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon of Oil</li>
            <li>1 Pot of Water</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon of Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <!-- ordered list care about and isplays some sort of order notation -->
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a pot 2/3 of the way with water and let it boil.</li>
            <li>Put a teaspoon of salt and oil into the pot as it boils.</li>
            <li>Put 70 grams or any desired amount of the packaged spagetti into the water, when the water has boiled.</li>
            <li>Let the spaghetti cook, as it cooks the spaghetti will become soft and fully submerge (please don't break the spaghetti, it's a crime to the Italians).</li>
            <li>After about 10 minutes, take a strand of spagetti out, fling it at a vertical surface, and see if it sticks (this is optional, maybe). If it doesn't stick, let it take 5 minutes longer. Repeat till it sticks to the wall (or you can just eyeball it, it's probably edible either way)</li>
            <li>After the spagetti is cooked, strain the water out of the pot. Put the spagetti on a plate and add a cup of marinara sauce to it (or as much as you like, I'm not judging).</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
