This recipe is the first food I cooked in my life. My best friend taught me how to make this. A basic spaghetti recipe with store-bought Marinara sauce, because I don't know how to cook. 

## Ingredient List 
- Store Brought Spaghetti (any brand works)
- Marinara Sauce (Go by Preference, I used Prego for this recipe)
- A Teaspoon of Oil
- A Pot of Water
- A Teaspoon of Salt

## Instructions: 
1. Fill a pot 2/3 of the way with water and let it boil.
2. Put a teaspoon of salt and oil into the pot as it boils.
3. Take a handful or any desired amount of the packaged spagetti into the water, when the water has boiled.
4. Let the spaghetti cook, as it cooks the spaghetti will become soft and fully submerge (please don't break the spaghetti, it's a crime to the Italians).
5. After about 10 minutes, take a strand of spagetti out, fling it at a vertical surface, and see if it sticks (this is optional, maybe). If it doesn't stick, let it take 5 minutes longer. Repeat till it sticks to the wall (or you can just eyeball it, it's probably edible either way)
6. After the spagetti is cooked, strain the water out of the pot. Put the spagetti on a plate and add a cup of marinara sauce to it (or as much as you like, I'm not judging). 
7. Enjoy!
