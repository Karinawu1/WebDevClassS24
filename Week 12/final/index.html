            <p>The Lobby (<a href="./pages/levels/level1.html">Level 1</a>) takes on the appearance from most of the backrooms posts you see online. The entire place is a sprawling and labyrinthine network of yellow-tinted walls adorned with mono-yellow wallpaper. It has a repeating yellow, moist carpet floor, and a regular tiled ceiling with fluorescent light sources that buzz incessantly. The lack of windows or natural light sources adds to the feeling of endlessness and claustrophobia. Black scribbled arrows are scattered across the walls, pointing towards the exit which is a vent, with a ladder to climb up.</p>

            <p>The Dark Rooms (<a href="./pages/levels/level2.html">Level 2</a>) look almost identical to the Lobby, with the primary difference being their darker and more claustrophobic atmosphere. The hallways are narrower, creating a more constricting and unsettling feeling for players. It's worth noting that the level seems to have a striking green lighting or tint, further enhancing its ominous appearance.</p>

            <p>The Parking (<a href="./pages/levels/level3.html">Level 3</a>) is a dark and damp underground garage plagued by valve leaks that create a poorly lit environment. The space is devoid of cars, and only a few pillars are scattered around to break up the vast expanse of darkness. This creates an oppressive and eerie atmosphere, as it is difficult to see more than a few feet in front of you due to the lack of light. The overall effect is that the parking lot feels abandoned and unwelcoming.

            <p>The Abandoned Office (<a href="./pages/levels/level4.html">Level 4</a>) is a dimly lit environment with flickering lights and peeling wallpaper on the walls. The floor is composed of an old-fashioned white concrete that gives it a dated and worn appearance. The setting bears a strong resemblance to a very old and eerie office, and is even darker than the previous three levels. It is filled with cubicles, desks, and various office supplies, creating a maze-like atmosphere that can be disorienting and difficult to navigate.

            <p>The Sewerage (<a href="./pages/levels/level5.html">Level 5</a>) are dark, damp, and dirty, with water flowing through them. The walls of the Sewerage are made of concrete and bricks, and there are sometimes pipes and valves running along the sides of the walls. The floors are covered in a layer of slime and moss, and there are occasional rocks or debris scattered around. There is a small area with grate flooring and walls.

            <p>The Terror Hotel (<a href="./pages/levels/level6.html">Level 6</a>) is an infinite hotel complex with many rooms and halls. The level itself appears to have been constructed in the 1930s, with furniture dating back to 1920. There are three (3) main areas in Level 5 that are fully accessible.

            <p>The Grassrooms (<a href="./pages/levels/level7.html">Level 7</a>) presents itself at first as a winding hallway with a grassy floor and sparse flowers. To your left, there are some windows that provide a view of a never-ending clouds, both above and below. As you venture deeper, the surroundings gradually transition into a more darker and enclosed setting. It looks like a giant greenhouse. On the walls, you might come across written inscriptions. And as you venture further, you'll eventually come across a Cathedral.
