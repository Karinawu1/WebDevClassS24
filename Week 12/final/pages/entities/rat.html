                <h2 class="title">Entity: Death Rat</h2>
                <p>The Death Rat is a significantly large rat with an appearance that is unmistakable. Its body is covered in a multitude of wounds and is missing it's eyes. Despite its scarred body, it still appears strong and tough due to its muscular build. It has a little bit of fur on it's back, being matted and unkempt, making it appear even more menacing. In terms of size, it is much larger than the average rat and can be quite intimidating to those who encounter it.
                </p>

                <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>
                    In the old sewer tunnels some forsaken creatures are housed, in the deepest corners of this space. They have never known outside light, adapting in this dark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Humid and disturbing environment in order to survive, their bodies are full of infections and their snouts are full of maligant bacteria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are blind althrough they are extremely aggressive, they have managed to develop a hearing that is very sensitive to any noise, if you run into one try not to move or make noise, remember for them we are only fresh meat in the middle of an endless wet tunnels. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Entity Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                    There are two Death Rats that aimlessly roam throughout the Sewerage and is unable to see, meaning it won't detect you even if you're right in front of it. However, be careful as any noise you make, like footsteps or whistling, will instantly draw its attention to the source of the sound, so if you see it, I'd recommend moving over to the side of the water and letting it pass. Most of the time the Death Rat is standing up, but sometimes it will run through the sewers on all fours. The Death Rat cannot get you while you are inside a room.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Strategies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        By whistling, you can lure both Death Rats to your position and they may accidentally push each other onto the side paths, becoming trapped.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Avoid the rats as much as possible.
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        Crouch walk when next to one, and keep out of their way. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remember they can hear everything. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                <h3>Extra</h3>
