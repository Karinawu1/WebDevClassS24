                <h3>Entity Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                    The Partygoer is an in-game entity that will wander around the present maze, or move through the walls of the candle maze. In the present maze, if the lights turn red, the Partygoer will look around for the player, if the player is in their line of sight, it will immediately chase them, whereas in the candle maze, it will simply chase the player, even walking through the red lines. In the present maze, the player has a chance to evade the Partygoer by running around a corner if they are far enough away. However, in the candle maze, the Partygoer will continuously pursue the player, making it impossible to escape once activated.
                </p>
                <br />
