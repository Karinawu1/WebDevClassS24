                <h2>Level 3: Parking</h2>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>The Parking is a dark and damp underground garage plagued by valve leaks that create a poorly lit environment. The space is devoid of cars, and only a few pillars are scattered around to break up the vast expanse of darkness. This creates an oppressive and eerie atmosphere, as it is difficult to see more than a few feet in front of you due to the lack of light. The overall effect is that the parking lot feels abandoned and unwelcoming.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h3>WalkThrough</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Your main objective is to find five Valve Handles and use them to seal five different pipes. Valve Handles spawn in random locations every time, so check around each pillar and along the walls for them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once you've sealed all five pipes, head up to the dead body and grab the Blue Key Card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now go to the white door, which will no longer have poisonous gas blocking it. Unlock the door with the Blue Key Card you obtained.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep running until you reach an elevator. Input the elevator code found on the note in the elevator into the keypad, and you will be transported to the Abandoned Office.
                    </li>
                </ol>
