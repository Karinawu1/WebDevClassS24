                <h2>Level 1: Lobby</h2>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>The Lobby takes on the appearance from most of the backrooms posts you see online. The entire place is a sprawling and labyrinthine network of yellow-tinted walls adorned with mono-yellow wallpaper. It has a repeating yellow, moist carpet floor, and a regular tiled ceiling with fluorescent light sources that buzz incessantly. The lack of windows or natural light sources adds to the feeling of endlessness and claustrophobia. Black scribbled arrows are scattered across the walls, pointing towards the exit which is a vent, with a ladder to climb up.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h3>WalkThrough</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wake up in the backrooms and follow the arrows drawn on the wall until you find the ladder.
                    </li>
                    <li>Climb the ladder through the vent to a large room with various supplies connected to the first puzzle room.
                    </li>
                    <li>In this puzzle room, players will see four pillars on the left side, each with a number on it. These numbers correspond to the digits of the elevator code. The numbers on the right side of the pillars indicate the order in which the digits should be entered. It's important to note that the code is randomly generated, so it will be different each time.
                    </li>
                    <li>Input the code in that order on the elevator keypad at the end of the room, this will take you to the Dark Rooms.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br/>

                <h3>Notes</h3>
                <p>In one of the corners of the Lobby contains a corpse holding a Moth Jelly.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>The Dark Rooms look almost identical to the Lobby, with the primary difference being their darker and more claustrophobic atmosphere. The hallways are narrower, creating a more constricting and unsettling feeling for players. It's worth noting that the level seems to have a striking green lighting or tint, further enhancing its ominous appearance.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Go to a nearby room to grab a Flashlight and check each of the drawers for important items such as a VHS Tape, Body Parts, Clock Hands, and a Time Note.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go into the morgue and check the pattern of the blood-stained bodies. Use them to solve the code on the locker, giving you a Hammer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go to the vase room, use the Hammer to break the vases until you get a Red Key.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Head to the painting room which you can now unlock using the Red Key you just collected. There will be five different paintings with hidden letters on them. Mark down each of the five different paintings' letters and determine the words spelled out by the paintings. Head to the very end of the painting room where you'll now input the word into the lock on this box. Grab the four Fuses and the Moth Jelly inside the unlocked box.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Head to the clock room and rotate the floating metal until the shadow casted from it appears in the shape of a horse, this will reveal a secret door.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go into the secret room and attach the Clock Hands to the clock, and turn them until they display the time you observed on the Time Note. This will reveal a note with a code on it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go to the room with a box and use that code to unlock the padlock on the box, giving you the Pliers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Find the VHS Tape, watch the tape on the TV, and note down the names listed as well as their missing Body Parts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Head to the morgue and find the names of the victims listed in the video and place their corresponding Body Parts on the tray, this will cause a mirror to break, allowing access to the lever room.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go to the lever room and flick some levers, then run back to the door to see if one of the lights on the lock has turned green. Turn off the switch you flicked if it didn't turn green, or leave the switch flipped on if it did. Do this with every switch in the room until all three of the red lights have turned green, unlocking the door and giving you access to all your Radiation Gear.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Head to the radiation area, equip your Protection Suit, and use your Geiger Counter to determine if an item laying on the floor is radioactive. If yes, spray them with your Fire Extinguisher. If not, move on and check another item. Keep doing this until you hear the beeping sound of the door being unlocked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go down the hallway and use the Pliers obtained earlier to unchain the exit door, then stand on the button in the next room until the garage door is fully raised and make a run for the room before it closes again. Drop down the hole to enter the Parking.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>The Parking is a dark and damp underground garage plagued by valve leaks that create a poorly lit environment. The space is devoid of cars, and only a few pillars are scattered around to break up the vast expanse of darkness. This creates an oppressive and eerie atmosphere, as it is difficult to see more than a few feet in front of you due to the lack of light. The overall effect is that the parking lot feels abandoned and unwelcoming.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <br/>

                    <li>
                        Your main objective is to find five Valve Handles and use them to seal five different pipes. Valve Handles spawn in random locations every time, so check around each pillar and along the walls for them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once you've sealed all five pipes, head up to the dead body and grab the Blue Key Card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now go to the white door, which will no longer have poisonous gas blocking it. Unlock the door with the Blue Key Card you obtained.

                    <li>
                        Keep running until you reach an elevator. Input the elevator code found on the note in the elevator into the keypad, and you will be transported to the Abandoned Office.

                    <h3>Information</h3>
                    <p>The Abandoned Office is a dimly lit environment with flickering lights and peeling wallpaper on the walls. The floor is composed of an old-fashioned white concrete that gives it a dated and worn appearance. The setting bears a strong resemblance to a very old and eerie office, and is even darker than the previous three levels. It is filled with cubicles, desks, and various office supplies, creating a maze-like atmosphere that can be disorienting and difficult to navigate.

                        <li>
                            After collecting the Medallions and Keys, head to the storage room and unlock the door. Grab the Oil Drums and a Bucket before leaving. Solve the small wire puzzle using the information obtained from the note in the garbage room. This will disable some lethal spikes located in the Jail Maze.

                            Solve the number sliding puzzle. The number combination is random each time, so It might be helpful to use an online solver to solve the puzzle. This will disable the crushers in the crusher room.

                        <li>
                            Head to the crusher room and note the order of the Medallions on the statue.

                        <li>
                            Go back to the water treatment room. Use the key to unlock the medallion room. Pour the oil into the three pipes to make the Clumps leave the water. Input the medallions in the order displayed on the statue to destroy it.

                        <li>
                            Head back to the statue and pick up the Gear Cog.

                        <li>
                            With the Gear Cog in hand, head to the counterweight room. Solve the puzzle using the lever you picked up in the garbage room, and the cog you picked up in the crusher room. Insert the gear and attach the handle to one of the gears, then rotate the handle. The gears will click when you have the lever in the right direction. Unattach the lever and put it on another gear cog to turn that one to the right direction too. This will make the walls in the jail cells fall down, allowing access for you to grab the Sewer Exit Key and to use your bucket to pick up some human remains. Also, take note of the information found on a note in one of the cells as well.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Head to the exit. While you're there, go to the end of the hallway and grab one more piece of information from a note there.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Enter the final room in the Sewerage. Throw down the human remains so the Baby Death Rats do not attack you.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sneak past the Death Rat to two separate wire panels. Solve the wire puzzles using the information from the two sewer exit notes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once the wire puzzles have been solved, you're done! You can now go through the unlocked exit door and climb the ladder. You have successfully escaped the Sewerage.

                            Starting from your current location, make your way to the painting room. In the painting room, solve the first puzzle by finding rooms with matching paintings and noting down their corresponding room numbers. Once you find all of the matching paintings and their room numbers, input the room numbers into the paintings to unlock the small box. Inside the box, you will find the Stone Face.

                            Visit the Museum where you will find a collection of three fossils, and among them, one will contain a Gem inside. Because you can only pick up one at a time, pick the fossils up one by one by placing equivalent weights in their place to avoid triggering the alarm and trapping yourself. Once you have a fossil, take it to the bathroom. In order to see if there's a Gem inside, soak the fossil in the bathtub until it dissolves. If there isn't a Gem inside, go back and get another fossil. If there is a Gem remaining, pick it up.

                            Go back to the boiler room and repair the three pipes by placing pipes in the missing spots. While you're there, set each of the three boilers to the corresponding temperatures that were noted down. Flick the switch found in the same room as the pipes to activate the boilers, this will stun the Death Moths causing them to lose interest in you as a target.
