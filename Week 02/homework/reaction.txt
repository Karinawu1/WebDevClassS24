I didn't realize how many people were involved within the creation of a website. 
I know designers and the software engineers are involved but I didn't know the marketing team 
and sales team were also involved. 
There's a lot of thought that goes into wireframing, how the peopple will react/understand the information
and the problem you're trying to solve with it.
